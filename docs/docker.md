# Docker

## Containerisation

Containers aren't a new idea.  In 1979 the idea of isolating processes implemented in Unix V6.

In the 2000's they were half usable.  FreeBSD and Solaris had there versions but only the most hard core of OPS did anything with them.

Then came docker in 2013.  They made containisation accessible to the masses by abstracting away a lot of the complexity.
